        <p class="history__text">
          Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, commonly referred to as BMW, is a German
          multinational corporate manufacturer of luxury vehicles and
          motorcycles headquartered in Munich, Bavaria, Germany.<br /><br />
          The corporation was founded in 1916 as a manufacturer of aircraft
          engines, which it produced from 1917 until 1918 and again from 1933 to
          1945.<br /><br />
          Automobiles are marketed under the brands BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce,
          and motorcycles are marketed under the brand BMW Motorrad.<br /><br />
          In 2017, BMW was the world's fourteenth-largest producer of motor
          vehicles, with 2,279,503 vehicles produced.<br /><br />
          The company has significant motorsport history, especially in touring
          cars, Formula 1, sports cars and the Isle of Man TT.<br /><br />
          BMW is headquartered in Munich and produces motor vehicles in Germany,
          Brazil, China, India, Mexico, the Netherlands, South Africa, the
          United Kingdom, and the United States.<br /><br />
          The Quandt family is a long-term shareholder of the company (with the
          remaining shares owned by public float), following brothers Herbert
          and Harald Quandt's investments in 1959 which saved the company from
          bankruptcy.
        </p>
        <h3 class="history__subtitle">How the BMW logo as changed:</h3>
        <p class="history__text">
          The circular blue and white BMW logo or roundel evolved from the
          circular Rapp Motorenwerke company logo, which featured a black ring
          bearing the company name surrounding the company logo, on a plinth a
          horse's head couped.<br /><br />
          BMW retained Rapp's black ring inscribed with the company name, but
          adopted as the central element a circular escutcheon bearing a
          quasi-heraldic reference to the coat of arms (and flag) of the Free
          State of Bavaria (as the state of their origin was named after 1918),
          being the arms of the House of Wittelsbach, Dukes and Kings of
          Bavaria.<br /><br />
          However, as the local law regarding trademarks forbade the use of
          state coats of arms or other symbols of sovereignty on commercial
          logos, the design was sufficiently differentiated to comply, but
          retained the tinctures azure (blue) and argent (white).<br /><br />
          The current iteration of the logo was introduced in 2020, removing 3D
          effects that had been used in renderings of the logo, and also
          removing the black outline encircling the rondel. The logo will be
          used on BMW's branding but will not be used on vehicles.<br /><br />
          The origin of the logo as a portrayal of the movement of an aircraft
          propeller, the BMW logo with the white blades seeming to cut through a
          blue sky, is a myth which sprang from a 1929 BMW advertisement
          depicting the BMW emblem overlaid on a rotating propeller, with the
          quarters defined by strobe-light effect, a promotion of an aircraft
          engine then being built by BMW under license from Pratt & Whitney.<br /><br />For
          a long time, BMW made little effort to correct the myth that the BMW
          badge is a propeller.<br /><br />
          It is well established that this propeller portrayal was first used in
          a BMW advertisement in 1929, twelve years after the logo was created,
          so this is not the true origin of the logo.
